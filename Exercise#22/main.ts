/*Q-22:- Intentional Error: If you havenâ€™t received an array index error in one of your programs yet, try to 
make one happen. Change an index in one of your programs to produce an index error. Make sure you correct the 
error before closing the program.*/

let Guest:string[]=["Ali", "Noor", "Sidra"];
console.log(Guest[3]) //Intentional Error. In the array there are three guest from index 0 to index 2.
console.log(Guest[2]) //Correction. Sidra is the 3rd and last in the Guest list, its index is 2.
